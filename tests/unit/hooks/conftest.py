"""Shared fixtures for ``tests/unit/hooks/`` — Slice-2.5 PR-A Task 6.

These fixtures are the test-side bookend of the :class:`HookRegistry`'s
gate-and-sink injection seams (spec §0 + the alfred-core-engineer-1
hardening). Every PR-A and PR-B test that exercises the registry consumes
one of them — never instantiating a registry by hand at test scope —
because the registry is the module-level singleton seam and per-test
isolation is enforced by :func:`alfred.hooks.registry.set_registry` /
:func:`get_registry` swap-and-restore, NOT by a fresh module import.

Four fixtures ship:

* :func:`fresh_registry` — the canonical default. Installs a brand-new
  :class:`HookRegistry` with a :class:`RealGate` constructed via
  :func:`tests.helpers.gates.make_deny_all_gate` (no grants, every
  check denies) and the registry's own default
  :class:`StructlogAuditSink`. The pre-test registry is captured at
  fixture entry and restored on teardown so cross-test contamination
  via the module-level singleton is impossible.
* :func:`fresh_registry_allow_system` — same shape, but the gate
  carries a wildcard ``system``-tier grant via
  :func:`tests.helpers.gates.make_allow_system_gate`. Used by tests
  that need to register a system-tier subscriber (Task 7's @hook
  decorator unit tests, Task 9's chain-deadline tests).
* :func:`spy_registry_allow_system` — the spy-sink composition of
  ``fresh_registry_allow_system``. Installs a :class:`HookRegistry`
  with a granted-system gate AND a :class:`SpyAuditSink` injected via
  constructor, so fault-path audit rows land on the test-visible
  recorder rather than the global structlog sink. Used by Task 11's
  §6.5 refusal-authorization tests and Task 12's reentry-bypass tests
  against system-tier subscribers — the only fixture combination that
  needs both axes (system permitted + sink observable).
* :func:`spy_sink` — a structural :class:`AuditSink` test double that
  records every ``emit(event, correlation_id, fields)`` into a flat
  list. Tasks 9-12 inject this into a :class:`HookRegistry` to assert the
  fault-path audit rows (`hooks.refusal`, `hooks.chain_timeout`,
  `hooks.subscriber_error`, `hooks.unauthorized_refusal`,
  `hooks.reentry_bypass`) without depending on global structlog state.

PR-S3-7 (spec §15.1 flag-day): the gate-construction calls migrated
from the Slice-2.5 ``DevGate(...)`` constructions to
:mod:`tests.helpers.gates` factories wrapping the production
:class:`RealGate` with an in-memory stub backend. The deny-path
semantics are preserved; only the backing-store shape changed.

The spy is a ``frozen=True, slots=True`` dataclass — same hot-path
discipline as the real :class:`StructlogAuditSink`. The ``calls`` list
itself is mutable (the recorder needs to append), but the dataclass
holds a stable reference; reassigning the list is rejected by
``FrozenInstanceError``.

    "constructor-only configuration" discipline as the real sink — the
    test double cannot drift away from the production type's contract.

    The ``calls`` list is captured by reference so a test that received
    the spy via fixture continues to see every subsequent emit. The
    defensive copy of ``fields`` (``dict(fields)``) is load-bearing: a
    caller that mutates the original mapping after the emit must not

    Tests that exercise the §6.5 refusal-authorization contract (Task 11)

    (Task 12) need BOTH axes:

    * **System permitted at the gate** so a ``system``-tier subscriber

    sink is shared via the :func:`spy_sink` fixture so the test that
    requests both ``spy_registry_allow_system`` AND ``spy_sink`` sees
    the exact same recorder pytest hands to the registry constructor.
