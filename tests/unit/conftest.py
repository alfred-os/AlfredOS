"""Shared fixtures for ``tests/unit/``.

These fixtures are **unit-test only** — they boot an in-memory SQLite engine
with the Slice-2 ORM schema mirrored via :meth:`Base.metadata.create_all` and
hand it back as a sync ``sessionmaker``. The matching Postgres integration
test for the resolver lives at ``tests/integration/identity/`` (T13) and uses
``testcontainers`` to exercise the full DDL (CHECK + partial-unique index +
``LISTEN/NOTIFY``).

Why SQLite at the unit layer:

* The resolver's Python logic (LRU eviction, version-counter bumps, operator
  upper-bound, last-operator-remove gate, language/budget validation) does
  not depend on Postgres-specific features. Running these ~16 tests under
  SQLite keeps the unit suite hermetic and sub-second.
* The Postgres-only features the resolver does use — ``pg_notify`` for the
  NOTIFY hook, partial-unique index enforcement on
  ``(user_id, platform) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`` — are exercised in T13.
  The resolver's :meth:`_notify` is dialect-aware (no-op on SQLite), so the
  unit tests can validate the surrounding transaction flow without a real
  Postgres.

The ``rate_limiter`` fixture returns the no-op double :class:`_NullRateLimiter`
(test-only re-export from ``alfred.identity``). PR D1 swaps in the real
in-process token-bucket implementation; until then, the resolver's
constructor accepts any object satisfying the ``RateLimiter`` Protocol.

    """Capture every ``AuditWriter.append`` call into an in-memory list.

    Promoted to ``tests/unit/conftest.py`` (rather than the audit-test-local
    conftest) because two unrelated subsystems assert on audit-row contents:
    the audit-writer's own unit tests AND the identity CLI tests (T14). pytest
    only resolves fixtures from conftests on the path to the test file, so a
    fixture defined under ``tests/unit/audit/`` cannot be consumed from
    ``tests/unit/identity/``. The unit-level conftest sits on both paths and
    is the cheapest place to share the fixture without duplication.

    Yields the list itself so tests can ``assert audit_buffer[-1]["event"]``
    after invoking a CLI subcommand. The list is fresh per test — pytest
    scopes ``monkeypatch`` to function by default, so captures from one test
    never leak into another.

    Production callers continue to call ``AuditWriter(...).append(...)``
    unchanged; the monkeypatch swaps the bound method on the class for the
    duration of the test so any factory that constructs an
    :class:`AuditWriter` is a no-op as far as the database is concerned —
    we never touch Postgres in the unit layer.
