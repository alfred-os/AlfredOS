"""Plugin → host JSON-RPC notification sink + frame builders (PR-S4-9 #206).

The Discord adapter emits four plugin→host notifications over stdio
(``inbound.message``, ``adapter.binding_request``, ``adapter.rate_limit_signal``,
``adapter.crashed``). Each is a JSON-RPC *notification* — a ``{"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": <name>, "params": {...}}`` frame with NO ``id`` (the host does not
reply to a notification).

This module owns the single :class:`NotificationSink` contract every emitter
writes through, plus the frame builders that stamp the wire method names. The
production sink writes one line-delimited JSON frame to ``sys.stdout`` (matching
the host's line-delimited transport); the emitters are constructed with the sink
so they hold no I/O global and are unit-testable with a recording double.

The ``params`` payloads mirror the host-side ADR-0024 notification schemas in
``alfred.comms_mcp.protocol`` (``RateLimitSignal`` / ``BindingRequestNotification``
/ ``CrashedNotification`` / ``InboundMessageNotification``). The builders take an
already-validated source model and emit its ``model_dump`` so a typo'd field
surfaces host-side as a loud validation failure (the host re-parses the frame).
