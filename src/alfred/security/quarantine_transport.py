"""Host-side request/response transport carrying a T3 body to the quarantined LLM.

PR-S4-11c-2a (epic #237). This module owns the host half of the
inline-over-wire content path (ADR-0029): the raw T3 inbound body travels to the
(eventually launcher-spawned) quarantined LLM via a ``quarantine.ingest`` request
sent immediately BEFORE the ``quarantine.extract`` request the
:class:`alfred.security.quarantine.QuarantinedExtractor` drives. The child stays
storeless — it caches the ingested body in-process and pops it single-use on
extract; the host owns a single-use staging map that the transport drains when it
ships the ingest.

Three collaborators:

* :class:`QuarantineStagingMap` — the host-side single-use staging store
  (``handle.id -> TaggedContent[T3]``). A second drain of the same id is a loud
  refusal (replay defence — the laundering-window close from ADR-0029).
* :class:`T3BodyRecorder` — the ``record_body`` seam
  :class:`alfred.comms_mcp.bootstrap.CommsExtractorBridge` calls before
  ``extractor.extract``. It tags the inbound body ``TaggedContent[T3]`` via the
  authorised :func:`alfred.security.tiers.tag_t3_with_nonce` boot nonce and stages
  it. A ``None`` nonce is a loud refusal (mirrors StdioTransport's
  ``NonceNotConfigured`` guard); a WRONG nonce surfaces ``tag_t3_with_nonce``'s
  own ``ValueError``.
* :class:`QuarantineStdioTransport` — a :class:`alfred.plugins.transport.PluginTransport`
  driven by the :class:`QuarantinedExtractor`. On ``quarantine.extract`` it drains
  the staged body, sends ``quarantine.ingest{handle_id, context}`` then
  ``quarantine.extract{...}`` over a length-prefixed JSON-RPC child-IO seam, reads
  the reply frame, and returns a :class:`ControlResult`. It does NOT subclass
  :class:`alfred.plugins.stdio_transport.StdioTransport` — its content/control
  branch and direct-exec spawn are the wrong behaviour here; this transport reuses
  only the length-prefix framing convention and is driven against an injected
  child-IO seam so the real launcher-spawn (PR-S4-11c-2b) and the child MCP loop +
  LLM (PR-S4-11c-2c) stay out of scope.

#
# WHY IT MUST EXIST: unbounded, the preamble sits entirely OUTSIDE the §17 timeout nesting.
# Under gateway degradation the outer ``action_deadline`` fires mid-preamble and the extraction
# dies as an anonymous deadline kill — the graceful ``provider_unavailable`` refusal and the
# ``egress.broker.refused`` forensic row (the very artefacts this path exists to produce) are
# never reached.
#
# THE ARITHMETIC: the preamble is SEQUENTIAL with the ``read_frame`` bound, not nested inside
# it, so both must fit within the outer deadline:
#
#     preamble(4) + host_read(25) = 29 < action_deadline(30)          [success path]
#     preamble(4) + refusal(<=11) = 15 < action_deadline(30)          [refusal path]
#
# which preserves the documented nesting ``action_deadline(30) > host_read(25) >
# gateway_handshake(22) > child_budget(20) > sdk_read(8)`` — pinned by
# ``test_broker_preamble_bound_nests_under_the_action_deadline`` and the §17 hierarchy suite.
#
# The refusal leg previously read "failure-row write(<=5)" with NOTHING pinning the 5: the
# whole fail-closed path (revoke + row) ran outside every ceiling, and the reap underneath was
# SIGTERM-only with an unbounded ``wait()``. A child declining to die blew the action_deadline
# AND starved ``record_broker_failure``. Every term is now a real constant, not prose.
#
# WHY 4s IS AMPLE: with the CONNECT phase now gathered (A1) the batch costs ONE connect RTT to a
# co-located gateway (sub-millisecond on a docker network), N local AF_UNIX ``sendmsg`` calls
# (microseconds), and N+1 audit appends (single-digit ms). 4s is ~3 orders of magnitude of
# headroom. It does mean this bound, not ``control_fd_broker._CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S`` (10s), is the
# effective connect ceiling on the golive path — deliberate: 10s of connect latency is already a
# dead extraction, and refusing at 4s buys the forensics.

# above cites, so the refusal leg is pinned by code rather than asserted in a comment.

        on the timeout context's ``.expired()``, because ``EgressBrokerAuditor`` raises
        ``TimeoutError`` in its own right when its bounded ``append_schema`` hangs. Ungated,
        this arm caught a FAILED, NON-SKIPPABLE AUDIT WRITE and returned a graceful typed
        refusal — precisely the laundering HARD #5 forbids and the third bullet below
        disclaims. A callee's ``TimeoutError`` revokes (the sockets are already queued) and
        then propagates.

        **Any failure that could leave fds in the child REVOKES the capability** (A2/A3) by
        tearing the child down. Three arcs reach it:

        * a SEND-phase partial failure (``exc.delivered > 0``): connect-defer makes the CONNECT
          half all-or-nothing but cannot make the SEND half atomic, so k-1 live sockets sit in
          the child's SCM_RIGHTS queue that no drain will reclaim (the drain only runs in the
          extract branch's ``finally``, and this path writes no extract frame);
        * the preamble deadline: the delivery count is unknowable, so revoke conservatively;
        * a post-broker exception — an audit-row write that raises or a fail-closed hookpoint
          that denies (A3). The sockets are ALREADY queued at that point, so without the revoke
          the child would hold live provider-reachable fds with NO durable audit row and NO
          teardown: an un-recorded, un-revoked capability grant. The exception still propagates
          (a failed audit write is loud — HARD #5 — never laundered into a soft refusal); the
          revoke merely happens first.

        A ``delivered == 0`` broker failure (the COMMON gateway-down case) deliberately does NOT
        revoke: nothing reached the child, so there is no capability to revoke and no desynced
        queue, and killing the child would turn a transient outage into a hard-down quarantine
        path.

        Killing the child is what makes the connect-defer invariant TRUE rather than merely
        narrower: it revokes the granted capability and discards the desynced socket queue
        atomically, in one step the kernel guarantees.

        **Operational consequence (tracked):** the child is spawned exactly ONCE, at daemon boot
        (``_build_comms_inbound_extractor``); there is no respawn scheduler. After a revoke,
        subsequent extractions degrade GRACEFULLY rather than crashing — the control-parent
        socket is closed, so ``_send_one`` fails immediately with ``sendmsg_failed`` and every
        later dispatch returns this same ``provider_unavailable`` typed refusal plus its own
        ``egress.broker.refused`` row — but the quarantine path stays down until the daemon is
        restarted. That is the correct fail-closed trade against leaving un-revoked gateway
        capability in a T3-holding child.

        A teardown that itself FAILS (``aclose`` raises) is logged LOUD with an explicit
        ``error_class`` and swallowed (never silent — HARD #7): it must not preempt the
        caller's graceful typed refusal, which is the orchestrator's only clean exit.

        A teardown that is CANCELLED (a daemon-stop force-cancel, a TaskGroup sibling
        failure, an outer ``action_deadline``) is different (#472 finding 2): it completes
        the kill SYNCHRONOUSLY via :meth:`_abort_child_now` and then RE-RAISES the cancel.
        A T3 child left alive holding brokered gateway sockets is the exact state this method
        prevents, so the kill must finish; but swallowing the cancel would break structured
        concurrency (the supervisor's ``await self._run_task`` never sees the task end
        cancelled; an enclosing ``TaskGroup`` waits on us; an outer ``asyncio.timeout`` never
        ``uncancel``s). So here structured-concurrency correctness outranks the graceful
        typed refusal — the cancel propagates, no typed refusal is produced.

        The counter increments BEFORE the teardown is attempted, deliberately: a revoke
        whose ``aclose`` raises (or is cancelled) is still a revocation, and is the case most
        worth alerting on. Counting afterwards would skip exactly those.
