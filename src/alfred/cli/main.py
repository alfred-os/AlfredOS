"""AlfredOS CLI entry point.

The CLI is the imperative shell. The lighter Settings-only surfaces
(``status``, ``alfred user *``) construct just the part of the slice-1/2
graph they need (``Settings`` → ``SecretBroker`` → ``ProviderRouter`` /
``IdentityResolver``) inside their own callbacks.

``chat`` no longer builds an in-process Textual graph. The comms-MCP
flag-day (PR-S4-10, #206) inverts the model: ``chat`` SPAWNS the
``plugins/alfred_tui`` MCP plugin through ``bin/alfred-plugin-launcher.sh``
(via :mod:`alfred.cli._launcher_spawn`) and the already-running daemon owns
the orchestrator graph. The in-process ``Orchestrator`` → ``AlfredTuiApp``
chain is gone from this layer; ``_chat_main`` is a thin launcher caller.
(End-to-end ``alfred chat`` is not yet functional — the TUI plugin ships the
wire contract only; see issue #237.)

The ``status`` command exits zero after printing a short health summary so
operators can sanity-check their `.env` before launching the TUI. The
``chat`` command spawns the TUI plugin. Friendly, ``t()``-routed error
messages are printed (and a non-zero exit code returned) when ``Settings``
fail to load or the launcher/daemon is unavailable — never a raw traceback.

CLAUDE.md hard rules honoured at this layer:

  #1  every operator-facing string is routed through ``t()``.
  #6  secrets are read via ``SecretBroker`` (env-backed in slice 1) — never
      ``os.environ`` at this layer.

The structlog redactor (``_redact``) is installed in front of every log
processor chain so any secret value caught by ``SecretBroker.redact()`` is
masked before it leaves the process.

Module-load discipline (PR-S3-6 perf-001)
-----------------------------------------

The chat-graph dependency chain — :class:`Orchestrator`,
:class:`BudgetGuard`, :class:`WorkingMemoryPool`, :class:`EpisodicMemory`,
:class:`AuditWriter`, :class:`OutboundDlp`, the SQLAlchemy engine +
provider adapters — costs hundreds of milliseconds at import time. Every
``alfred --help`` invocation previously pulled the entire graph just to
render the typer surface. The heavy imports are now scoped inside the
functions that need them (``_chat_main`` for the chat path,
``status`` / ``_user_bootstrap`` for the lighter Settings-only surfaces)
so module load only pays for the typer registration + i18n catalog.

Tests assert the discipline:
``tests/unit/cli/test_main_lazy_imports.py`` introspects ``sys.modules``
after a fresh ``import alfred.cli.main`` and fails if
``alfred.providers`` or ``alfred.memory`` were eagerly pulled in.
