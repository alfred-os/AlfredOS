"""Framed-transport envelopes + frame helpers for the core↔gateway tool-egress relay.

Spec C §4.2 mode-(b), epic #333. The connectivity-free core cannot open external
sockets, so for inspectable tool egress it hands a redacted :class:`EgressRequest`
to the gateway's :class:`alfred.gateway.egress_relay.EgressRelay` over a
**length-prefixed JSON-frame protocol on ``asyncio.start_server``** (the architect's
round-2 ruling — NOT HTTP POST, and NOT the payload-blind CONNECT proxy): the
core relay client speaks raw asyncio frames, so there is no second in-core httpx
construction site, and the parse surface is one ``extra="forbid"`` model rather
than a hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 server (no Content-Length / Transfer-Encoding
smuggling). The gateway re-runs DLP, enforces the SSRF chain, originates the real
TLS, and returns an :class:`EgressResponse`.

This module is the ONE wire-bytes definition shared by both ends (the gateway
server in B4 and the in-core client in C1), so the framing can never drift. It is
pure (Pydantic + asyncio stream helpers) — NO httpx, so it is not on the in-core
HTTP-egress import-guard allowlist.
