"""``InboundCanaryScanner`` — system-tier hook subscriber on
``tool.web.fetch`` ``kind=post`` (spec §7.6).

Runs on the **plugin-host side**, NOT in the orchestrator process. The
scanner reads from the Redis content store by ``handle_id`` using a
read-only peek (``GETEX`` with no expiry options — Redis preserves the
existing TTL by default) so a clean scan leaves the handle consumable
by the orchestrator's quarantine-extract path. On a canary trip:

1. Log a structured warning ``web_fetch.canary.tripped`` for the
   operator's alerting pipeline.
2. **Quarantine** the handle (DELETE) BEFORE raising. A compromised
   downstream consumer cannot race to dereference the trip'd content
   because the key is already gone from Redis at the moment
   :class:`WebFetchCanaryTripped` propagates.
3. Raise :class:`WebFetchCanaryTripped` — a SECURITY EVENT, not a
   :class:`WebFetchError`. The orchestrator's hook dispatcher surfaces
   the typed exception; the orchestrator catches it and emits the
   ``tool.web.fetch.canary_tripped`` audit row.

Why a hook subscriber (ADR-0014): the previous shape would have
required every T3-ingesting tool to call its own scanner explicitly.
Placing the scanner as a system-tier ``post`` subscriber means future
T3 tools (email.read, mcp.tool.output, RAG retrievers) inherit canary
scanning by virtue of a system-tier subscriber existing on their
respective hookpoints. There is one scanner class — and exactly one
::

    SCANNER_HOOKPOINT
    SCANNER_TIER
    SCANNER_KIND

…trio per hookpoint owner. Task 6 wires the registration.

Naming disambiguation (spec rvw-007):

* :class:`alfred.plugins.inbound_scanner.InboundContentScanner` — scans
  every stdio-transport inbound frame for DLP patterns (synchronous,
  byte-offset reporting). Inline in ``StdioTransport.dispatch``.
* :class:`InboundCanaryScanner` (this module) — system-tier hook
  subscriber on ``tool.web.fetch``; reads the content store by handle
  id and scans for operator-registered canary tokens.

They are different classes with different responsibilities; never
import one in place of the other.
