"""Sandbox policy schema + bwrap-flag translator (spec §7.2, PR-S4-6 Component D).

A ``config/sandbox/<name>.linux.bwrap.policy`` file is TOML describing the
bwrap isolation a ``kind: full`` plugin runs under. :class:`SandboxPolicy`
validates that TOML; :func:`policy_to_bwrap_flags` translates it into the
bwrap CLI flag list the launcher execs.

PR-S4-6 ships the *schema* + *translator* + a fixture-only policy file. The
quarantined-LLM's real policy bytes ship in PR-S4-7.

Two load-bearing invariants:

* **arch-2 — fd 3 is mandatory.** The Supervisor delivers the quarantined
  provider key over fd 3 (see :mod:`alfred.supervisor.fd3_key_delivery`). A
  ``kind: full`` policy whose ``keep_fds`` omits 3 would silently sever that
  channel, so the model refuses it at construction with
  :class:`SandboxPolicyInvalid` (``reason="kind_full_requires_keep_fd_3"``).

* **fd 3 is inherited by default — NO bwrap flag is emitted (issue #218).**
  bubblewrap passes inherited, open, non-CLOEXEC fds (fd 3 = the provider-key
  channel) into the sandboxed child BY DEFAULT — no flag is needed. Verified
  empirically in a docker repro against the exact production image (Debian
  Bookworm, bubblewrap **0.8.0**) and **0.9.0**: with the pipe's read end
  ``dup2``'d onto fd 3 in the launcher, the sandboxed plugin reads fd 3 and
  gets the key with no CLI flag. The flags that LOOK relevant are harmful:
  ``--sync-fd FD`` ("Keep this fd open while sandbox is running") keeps the fd
  open in bwrap's OWN monitor process for its internal sync protocol, and
  pointing it at fd 3 CONSUMES fd 3 so the child's ``os.read(3)`` raises EBADF.
  There is no ``--keep-fd`` in 0.8.0/0.9.0. So the translator emits NO fd flag.
  The logical field name ``keep_fds`` is retained as a validated *declaration*
  (arch-2 refuses a kind:full policy that omits fd 3); the inheritance itself
  is bwrap's default and needs no CLI surface. (NB: fd-3 delivery ALSO requires
  the spawning parent to place the pipe's read end ON fd 3 — see
  ``fd3_key_delivery`` + the resolver test's preexec dup2.)

    in this file already — each one a path that was arch-variable in fact and
    invisible to the rule in force at the time:

    * ``/lib64`` in ``ro_binds`` (the original #269).
    * ``/lib64`` in ``rw_binds`` — a different field, same missing source.
    * ``/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`` — UNDER it, so membership missed it.
    * ``/lib64/`` , ``//lib64``, ``/usr/../lib64`` — respellings, so string
      equality missed them.
    * ``/lib64/..`` — TRAVERSES it and then lexically escapes, so the canonical
      form (``/``) missed it, even though the kernel must still enter ``/lib64``.
    * ``/usr/lib64`` and ``/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`` — the SAME directories under
      other names, so a one-spelling list missed them.

    Each fix was declared "the class-closing invariant". Each was wrong. **A
    lexical rule cannot decide a filesystem fact, so assume variant seven exists.**

    What this function is FOR: catching the known spellings cheaply, at parse time,
    with an auditable refusal — defence in depth, and a fast signal for the
    misconfiguration we can foresee.

    What actually CLOSES the class: the ``Integration (privileged Linux, real
    spawn) (arm64)`` CI lane (a required check), which launches REAL bwrap against
    the SHIPPED policies on aarch64. A path that is arch-variable in fact but
    invisible to this rule still fails there, loudly, before it can merge. That
    lane — not this function — is the guarantee. Do not weaken it, and do not let
    a green parse here persuade you that a new bind is safe.

    Mechanically: walk the RAW components, because the kernel resolves a path one
    component at a time and every component it walks must exist — including ones a
    later ``..`` removes. That single rule subsumes membership, containment and

    NOTE — we deliberately do NOT *refuse* non-canonical policy paths, and we do

    one meaning — an appealing invariant) and it was WRONG: real policy paths are
    often derived from the filesystem and legitimately contain ``..`` — e.g. a
    Homebrew interpreter root, ``/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin/../Frameworks/…``.
    Those ``..`` segments CROSS SYMLINKS, so normalising them *lexically* yields a
    different, wrong path (the classic ``normpath`` vs ``realpath`` trap), and
    refusing them breaks legitimate callers. Only ``realpath`` could canonicalise
    them safely, and this module must not touch the filesystem.

    So the canonical form is used ONLY to COMPARE paths inside the guards below,
    which is what actually closes the hole; bwrap resolves the declared path itself.

    Every guard below compares paths. Comparing them as RAW STRINGS is a hole:
    ``/lib64``, ``/lib64/``, ``//lib64``, ``/lib64/.`` and ``/usr/../lib64`` are
    the SAME path to bwrap and five different strings to Python. A guard keyed on

    four — each of which still emits a hard bind that aborts the launch on an arch
    where the source is absent (#269, third variant).

    Lexical only — deliberately NO ``realpath``/``resolve``: this translator is
    host-independent and unit-testable precisely because it never touches the
    filesystem, and resolving symlinks HERE would make a policy's meaning depend
    on the machine that parsed it.

    ``posixpath.normpath`` collapses ``.``, ``..``, and duplicate/trailing
    slashes, but POSIX permits a leading ``//`` to be implementation-defined and

          ``is_over_broad_bind_source`` applied to the raw source directly — there
          is no arch-variable exemption here; ``_refuse_hard_bind_of_arch_variable_path``
          already refuses a hard bind of an arch-variable root separately.
        * The soft field (``ro_binds_try``) gets the SAME three-tier rule
          (``is_over_broad_bind_source``), but applied to the CANONICAL source, and
          exempting a genuine arch-variable root (``_is_arch_variable`` on that same
          canonical form) — ``ro_binds_try`` legitimately carries the depth-1
          arch-variable root ``/lib64`` that tier 3 would otherwise wrongly refuse.
          Canonicalising before the arch-variable check is what closes sec-001: a
          traversal like ``/lib64/../etc`` is arch-variable on the RAW walk (it
          enters ``/lib64`` before backing out) but its EFFECTIVE path is ``/etc``,
          which is over-broad and not itself arch-variable — so it is refused,
          while ``/lib64`` (canonicalises to itself) stays allowed.

        Keys on the SOURCE, like ``_refuse_hard_bind_of_arch_variable_path``: bwrap
        cares about the source. This is a lexical floor, not a filesystem oracle —
        see ``is_over_broad_bind_source`` for what it cannot decide. Do NOT read this
        as class-closing: it closes the ``/lib64/..``-style traversal bypass, not the
