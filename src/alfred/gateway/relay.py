"""``GatewayRelay`` — the gateway's two-direction opaque payload relay (Spec A G3-3b-2).

The relay is the engine that joins the gateway's two legs into a resumable front door
(ADR-0032 / #237). It owns NO socket of its own: it is handed a live
:class:`GatewayCoreLink` (the core-facing half — dial + handshake + supervised pump +
reconnect) and a client transport (the accepted TUI connection), and it wires them so an
opaque payload flows end-to-end byte-for-byte in BOTH directions:

* **core -> client** IS :meth:`GatewayCoreLink.run` (the merged supervised pump). The
  relay binds that pump's ``payload_relay`` sink to :meth:`_send_to_client`, so every
  opaque payload the core leg forwards (a frame that is NOT a consumed ``daemon.lifecycle.*``
  control frame) is written down to the client. The reconnect/backoff/lifecycle-signal
  machinery all lives in the core-link — the relay rides it.
* **client -> core** is :meth:`_client_to_core_pump`: a second pump that reads the
  client transport's raw units and calls :meth:`GatewayCoreLink.relay_to_core`, doing
  ZERO body parse on that leg (a PURE opaque forward — security H3; the client leg never
  inspects the payload, the core re-parses).

**Production wire (the leg asymmetry).** The core leg is seq/ack-ENABLED (the daemon's
``CommsPluginRunner`` negotiates ``AlfredSeqAck/1`` in the handshake); the client (TUI)
leg is PLAIN — the real ``alfred chat`` never negotiates seq/ack. So on the production
shape the client-send carries ``ack=0`` (the plain transport ignores it and emits a
plain ADR-0025 line) and the client-leg receive ack is moot. A seq-enabled-client variant
is forward-looking (G4/G5): the relay maintains a SEPARATE client-receive tracker so the
client-leg ack is RESEQUENCED — the gateway's own client-side cumulative ack, never the
core-leg seq passed through. Which mode is live is learned from the client handshake and
passed in as ``client_seq_enabled``.

**Payload-blind (CLAUDE.md hard rule #5).** The relay NEVER ``json.loads`` a payload
body. The ONLY method-peek in the whole gateway is the core-link's lifecycle router
(:meth:`GatewayCoreLink._route_unit`), which peeks the method to CONSUME the two
lifecycle control frames; everything else — including the entire client->core leg — is
forwarded as opaque bytes. The inner JSON-RPC ``id`` the runner correlates on lives
inside that opaque run and survives end-to-end.

**Loud drops, no buffering (CLAUDE.md hard rule #7; G4 owns buffering).** A dead client
(broken pipe) on the core->client sink is a LOUD drop that does NOT raise into the core
pump (the client hung up — the core leg keeps running). A gapped core on the client->core
leg is a LOUD drop in :meth:`GatewayCoreLink.relay_to_core` (never buffered). The dropped
unit is the peer's to re-request once the leg is back — a G4 ReplayBuffer concern, not
this carrier's to hold.
