"""``GatewayProcess`` — the runnable ``alfred-gateway`` front door (Spec A G3-3b-2b / ADR-0031).

This is the process that joins every gateway half into a runnable whole. It mirrors the
daemon's socket-carrier (:func:`alfred.cli.daemon._commands._listen_socket_comms_adapter`):

* **bind the client listener inline (fail-closed)** — binding the ``0600`` owner-only
  client socket under the ``0700`` runtime dir is a gateway-owned, startup-time operation,
  so a bind failure (``OSError``) propagates LOUD and REFUSES the start (CLAUDE.md hard
  rule #7) — never a half-bound front door;
* **accept ONE client, racing shutdown** — the client connection is held for the life of
  the process (single-accept-for-life, architect L1); the accept is raced against the
  shutdown event so a clean stop before a client ever connects returns promptly;
* **run the client-leg HOST handshake** — the gateway stands in for the daemon toward an
  unmodified TUI: it SENDS ``lifecycle.start`` and reads the ack. A handshake failure
  (:class:`GatewayHandshakeError`) propagates LOUD (fail-closed) — never a half-wired relay;
* **build + supervise the relay** — the merged :class:`GatewayCoreLink` (core dial +
  handshake + reconnect + the §9 lifecycle signal) and the :class:`GatewayRelay` (the
  two-direction opaque payload pump) are constructed and ``relay.run()`` is awaited;
* **reap on EVERY exit path** — the listener (its accepted transport + the socket file) is
  reaped in a ``finally`` on every exit: a clean shutdown, a handshake/bind raise, OR a
  cancel/``KeyboardInterrupt`` unwind (the security-M2 cancel reap). The core transport is
  reaped by :meth:`GatewayCoreLink.run`'s own ``finally``; the client transport by the
  listener's :meth:`GatewayClientListener.aclose`.

**Payload-blind (CLAUDE.md hard rule #5).** This process adds NO payload parse — it only
wires the legs. The single method-peek in the whole gateway lives in the core-link's
lifecycle router; everything else is forwarded as opaque bytes.

**No ``t()`` here (operator strings are the CLI's job, Task 5).** This module emits only
structlog keys; the operator-facing ``alfred gateway`` command text lands in the CLI cut.
