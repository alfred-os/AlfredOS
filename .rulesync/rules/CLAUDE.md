# CLAUDE.md — AlfredOS Repo Operating Manual

This file is loaded by AI agents working in this repository. Read it before doing anything.

## What this is

**AlfredOS** is a multi-user, multi-persona, security-hardened agentic OS. Self-hostable. Licensed under **Apache-2.0**. **Alfred** (no "OS") is the name of the default persona that ships enabled.

Full design: see [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md). Read it before proposing any architectural change.

**Runtime state lives outside the repo** at `/var/lib/alfred/state.git`. The agent commits its proposed self-modifications there; the reviewer agent reviews; merges activate. Never commit runtime state into the source repo.

## Tech stack

- **Language (core):** Python 3.12+
- **Async runtime:** asyncio
- **Plugins:** MCP (stdio for in-process, HTTP for remote) — polyglot
- **Datastores:** Postgres 16 (+ pgvector), Redis 7, Qdrant
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **Type system:** Pydantic v2 for data models; `mypy --strict` (primary) + `pyright` (secondary) for the core
- **Test framework:** pytest + testcontainers + custom adversarial harness
- **Observability:** structlog + Prometheus client + OpenTelemetry
- **Lint/format:** `ruff check` + `ruff format` (replaces black; see [`docs/python-conventions.md`](./docs/python-conventions.md))
- **Type-check (secondary):** `pyright` alongside mypy
- **Property tests:** `hypothesis` (where the function has a property you can state in one sentence)
- **Package manager:** uv

## Commands you should know

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Set up dev environment | `bin/dev-setup.sh` (creates `.venv`, installs deps, pulls test fixtures) |
| Run unit tests | `uv run pytest tests/unit -q` |
| Run integration tests | `uv run pytest tests/integration` (boots ephemeral containers) |
| Run smoke tests | `uv run pytest tests/smoke` (requires `docker compose up` running) |
| Run adversarial suite | `uv run pytest tests/adversarial` (release-blocking) |
| Lint + format check | `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .` |
| Type check | `uv run mypy src/ && uv run pyright src/` |
| All quality gates | `make check` (lint + format + type + test) |
| Local stack up | `docker compose up -d` |
| TUI conversation | `alfred chat` |
| Inspect state | `alfred status` (Slice 1); `alfred audit log` / `alfred audit graph --since 24h` (Slice 3) |
| Inspect a user's memory | `alfred memory show <user>` (planned — Slice 4+) |
| Cost report | `alfred cost report --since 7d --by persona` (planned — Slice 4+) |
| Manage users | `alfred user add|list|show|set|remove|bind|unbind` (see ADR-0010) |
| Plugin management | `alfred plugin grant <id> <tier> <hookpoint>` · `alfred plugin grant status <id>` · `alfred plugin grant list --pending` · `alfred plugin revoke <id>` (Slice 3; `alfred plugin list` / `show` hidden from `--help` per arch-006 follow-up) |
| Web fetch allowlist | `alfred web allowlist add <domain>` · `alfred web allowlist remove <domain>` · `alfred web allowlist list` (Slice 3) |
| Config (reviewer-gated) | `alfred config set quarantined-provider <value>` · `alfred config set web-fetch-budget <user> <n>` · `alfred config get <key>` · `alfred config list` (Slice 3) |
| Supervisor | `alfred supervisor status` · `alfred supervisor reset <component> --confirm` (Slice 3) |
| Audit (extended) | `alfred audit graph --tier T0|T1|T2|T3 --since 24h` (Slice 3) |

If a command lacks a slice marker, flag it. Commands
marked `(planned — Slice N+)` are scheduled — do NOT implement ahead of
slice (slice plans schedule WHEN each piece lands; CLAUDE.md and the PRD
are aspirational on overall command surface).

## How to work in this repo

### Process

1. **Read the PRD before structural changes.** If a change conflicts with the PRD, propose updating the PRD first.
2. **Use ADRs for architectural decisions.** New ADR in `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md` whenever you change a structural invariant.
3. **TDD where practical** — write a failing test, then make it pass. Especially for security boundaries.
4. **Small PRs.** One responsibility per PR. Reviewer (human or agent) should be able to hold the change in their head.
5. **Verify before claiming done.** Run the relevant test layer; do not assert "this works" without running it.

### Coding conventions

**Python work — use the [`alfred-python-developer`](./.rulesync/subagents/alfred-python-developer.md) subagent.** It applies the full conventions in [`docs/python-conventions.md`](./docs/python-conventions.md) without being asked: modern Python 3.12+ idioms, SOLID + FP, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0 typed, async-first, strong typing (mypy strict + pyright), hypothesis property tests, structlog with redaction.

The headline rules — restated here so they're impossible to miss:

- **Single responsibility, narrow interfaces.** A module's public surface is small; internals are not exported.
- **DRY across skills/plugins** via shared utilities. Reviewer rejects copy-paste reimplementations.
- **SOLID applied with judgment** — no premature abstractions; refactor on the second duplication, not the first.
- **Strong typing.** No `Any` without justification. Pydantic models at all serialization boundaries. `mypy --strict` + `pyright`.
- **Modern Python 3.12+.** PEP 604 unions (`X | Y`), PEP 585 built-in generics, PEP 695 generic syntax. Never `Optional[X]` or `typing.List`.
- **Immutability by default.** Frozen dataclasses, frozen Pydantic, `Mapping` over `dict` for read-only inputs.
- **Pure functions for transformations; classes for stateful machines.** Functional core, imperative shell.
- **Async-first** in the core. Avoid blocking calls in async code. Structured concurrency via `asyncio.TaskGroup`.
- **No global state.** Pass dependencies explicitly.
- **Errors loud at boundaries, structured inside.** No `except Exception: pass`. Custom exception hierarchy rooted at `AlfredError`.
- **Comments only when WHY is non-obvious** — name things well so WHAT doesn't need a comment.
- **Karpathy guidelines** — surgical changes, surface assumptions, verifiable success criteria. (See `andrej-karpathy-skills:karpathy-guidelines` skill.)

### Tests

- **Every skill** must ship with: happy-path test, error-path test, out-of-scope refusal test.
- **Every security boundary** must have 100% line and branch coverage (input tagging, capability gate, DLP, secret broker, audit writes).
- **Integration tests** use real Postgres/Redis/Qdrant via testcontainers; LLM responses are recorded fixtures except in `tests/smoke/`.
- **Adversarial tests** are release-blocking. If you change anything in `src/alfred/security/`, you must run the full adversarial suite locally.

## Security rules — HARD

These rules override everything else. Violating them is a release blocker.

1. **Never log secrets.** Use the redactor on every log path. Tests verify this.
2. **Never bypass the tool capability layer.** Even in tests, do not stub it to "always allow." Use a fixture grant.
3. **Always tag input trust tier.** Every function that ingests external content (web, email, file, MCP tool output) tags it `T3` at the boundary. No exceptions.
4. **DLP is on by default and cannot be disabled per-call.** Pure-internal tools can declare "no DLP needed" once in their manifest and the test suite verifies the claim.
5. **The privileged orchestrator never sees raw T3 content.** Only the quarantined LLM does, and only via the structured-extraction path.
6. **Secrets live in the broker, not in env vars accessible to plugins.** Plugins request secret IDs; the broker substitutes at the tool-call boundary.
7. **No silent failures in security paths.** Failed DLP, failed capability check, canary trip → loud audit entry + alert + (where appropriate) quarantine.
8. **No skipping pre-commit hooks** with `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the issue.

## Internationalization rules — HARD

i18n is baked in from Slice 1 because retrofitting it later is materially harder. Violating these is a release blocker.

1. **All operator-/user-facing strings go through `t()`.** Hardcoded English in `src/alfred/` outside the catalog source files is a release blocker. CLI output, TUI text, error messages, log messages destined for an operator's eyes — all `t()`.
2. **Persona system prompts honour `{user.language}`.** Every persona prompt template includes the user's language; the orchestrator substitutes the active user's language before each provider call.
3. **Every stored user content row has a `language` field.** `episodes`, `audit_log`, `semantic_facts` — anything that holds user text — carries a BCP-47 language tag.
4. **`pybabel extract` runs in pre-commit; `pybabel compile --check` runs in CI.** Catalog drift fails the build.
5. **Doc files stay English-only.** PRD, CLAUDE.md, ADRs, agent definitions, skill definitions. Localizing contributor docs is out of scope.

## Self-improvement rules

When you (the AI agent, future-you, or another agent) propose modifying Alfred itself:

1. **Reviewer-gated changes go through the proposal flow.** Branch `proposal/<id>` in `/var/lib/alfred/state.git`. Auto-generated tests. Sandboxed test run. Reviewer agent review. Merge on approval.
2. **Plugin install/remove requires additional human approval.** Not just the reviewer.
3. **Never edit `personas/`, `skills/`, or security policy on `main` directly** at runtime. Always via the proposal flow.
4. **Editing this `CLAUDE.md` or `PRD.md` is human-gated.** AI agents propose changes; humans approve.

## Memory etiquette

Two separate memory systems exist:

- **Alfred's runtime memory** is per-user, in Postgres + Qdrant. Managed by `src/alfred/memory/`. Do not touch outside that module.
- **Project memory (AI working memory)** for AI agents helping build Alfred lives in `~/.claude/memory/projects/alfred/` (canonical). Symlinked from the cwd-keyed location when this is a git repo. Writes go through `~/.claude/memory/bin/memory-write`, never direct Write/Edit.

When you learn something about the project, the user, or how to work here that future sessions will benefit from — write it to the right canonical file via the `/memory` skill.

## When you get stuck

1. Re-read the PRD section that covers what you're doing.
2. Look for an ADR that explains the decision.
3. Check `docs/superpowers/specs/` for design docs.
4. Use the `superpowers:brainstorming` skill before any creative work.
5. Use the `superpowers:systematic-debugging` skill before any bug fix.
6. Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill before any feature.
7. Use the `superpowers:verification-before-completion` skill before claiming done.
8. Ask the user. Don't make decisions you cannot defend.

**First-run seed (Slice 3+):** every `alfred plugin grant`, `alfred web allowlist add/remove`, and `alfred config set` call writes a proposal branch to `/var/lib/alfred/state.git`. If the repo doesn't exist yet, `bin/alfred-setup.sh` runs `bin/alfred-state-git-seed.sh` inside the `alfred-core` container, which is just `git init --bare /var/lib/alfred/state.git` + a seeded `main` branch. Safe to re-run; idempotent. If you see `bootstrap.capability_gate_unseeded` at startup, run the seed script.

## Do not

- Do not commit secrets, even to `.env.example`. Use placeholders.
- Do not edit `/var/lib/alfred/state.git` directly — only via the proposal flow.
- Do not weaken security defaults to make tests pass. Fix the test or the design.
- Do not introduce new datastores without an ADR.
- Do not add a fourth-party dependency without justification in the PR description.
- Do not silently catch exceptions in security paths.
- Do not skip the adversarial suite if you touched `src/alfred/security/`.
